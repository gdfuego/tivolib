There's not really too much to tell at this point.

This is the start of a python library for interfacing with your tivo device.
I have some ideas of where to go with it from here, but to start with I've
implemented a basic commandline utility to implement the functions that the 
library provides.

The code is available under the GPL version 2.

Feel free to contact me if you have any thoughts, bugs, etc.
